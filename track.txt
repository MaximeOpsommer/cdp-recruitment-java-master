Tracked issues

For the not working delete button, I first tried to reproduce the bug by deleting an event and refreshing the page to see that the event was still there.
And by navigating in the EventService, I immediately saw that a transactional context was missing, so the solution was to add a @Transactional Srping annotation

For the not working review, I tried to click on a number of stars for an event and refreshed the page.
The review was not updated.
Two things were missing : the implementation of the service and doing it in a transactional context
